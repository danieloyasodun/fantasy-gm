Perfect ‚Äî Fantasy GM is a **fun, unique, and technically impressive** choice. You‚Äôll get to show off API integrations, backend analytics, and LLM orchestration, and it‚Äôll be a memorable project for your portfolio.

Here‚Äôs a breakdown of **what your plan should look like moving forward**:

---

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Core Components & Workflow

1. **Data Layer**

   * **Sports APIs:** Pull live stats (Sleeper, SportsRadar, or ESPN unofficial API).
   * **Database:** Store player stats, rosters, historical performance.

     * Postgres is ideal for relational data (teams, players, matchups).
   * **Cache:** Redis for frequently accessed stats or leaderboard queries.

2. **Analytics Engine**

   * Calculate metrics like fantasy points per game, efficiency, injury risk, and matchup strengths.
   * Compare user roster vs league averages to detect weak spots.
   * Identify top waiver pickups and trade candidates.

3. **LLM Layer**

   * Input: roster + stats + league settings + available players.
   * Prompt: ‚ÄúAct as a fantasy sports GM. Suggest trades, lineups, and waiver pickups. Explain your reasoning.‚Äù
   * Output: structured recommendations plus narrative advice.
   * Optionally: enforce JSON schema so frontend can parse results easily.

4. **API Endpoints**

   * `GET /roster/{user_id}` ‚Üí returns current roster + stats.
   * `POST /recommendation` ‚Üí returns LLM advice.
   * `GET /players/trending` ‚Üí top waiver pickups or trade targets.
   * `POST /trade-simulation` ‚Üí simulate potential trade impact on projected points.

5. **Optional Extras**

   * Notifications via Discord, Slack, or email for trade or lineup suggestions.
   * Live scoring integration for real-time updates during games.
   * Frontend dashboard: drag-and-drop roster management + LLM advice panel.
   * Gamified features: ‚Äúteam efficiency score,‚Äù predictive rankings.

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Tech Stack Recommendation

* **Backend:** FastAPI (Python) or Node.js (Express/NestJS)
* **Database:** Postgres (rosters, stats, league settings)
* **Cache:** Redis (frequent queries, leaderboard updates)
* **LLM API:** OpenAI GPT-4o, Anthropic Claude, or similar
* **Deployment:** Docker + Render / Vercel / AWS
* **Optional Frontend:** React with charting for stats and LLM advice

---

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Step-by-Step Build Plan

**Week 1:**

* Set up backend skeleton + database schema
* Integrate sports API ‚Üí store and normalize data
* Build endpoints for fetching rosters and player stats

**Week 2:**

* Analytics engine ‚Üí calculate fantasy points, efficiency, and weak spots
* Implement caching for frequent queries
* Start experimenting with simple LLM prompts for advice

**Week 3:**

* Build `POST /recommendation` endpoint
* Refine LLM prompts ‚Üí structured JSON + narrative output
* Test LLM reasoning with multiple rosters and scenarios

**Week 4:**

* Optional: notifications or trade simulation endpoint
* Build minimal frontend to visualize advice
* Deploy backend + API to cloud

**Week 5:**

* Polish: error handling, rate limits, logging
* Write README + portfolio docs
* Demo playable version

If you want, I can **write a detailed system architecture diagram + API design** for Fantasy GM so you have a **concrete blueprint to start coding immediately**. This would include data flow, LLM interaction, and endpoint structure.

Do you want me to do that next?


Fantasy Sports GM Assistant

Concept:
A backend service that acts like a personal ‚Äúfantasy sports general manager.‚Äù It pulls live stats and player data from sports APIs, analyzes team rosters and league data, and uses an LLM to provide trade suggestions, lineup recommendations, and strategic advice.

Fully Implemented Features
1. Data Integration

Sports API connections: Pull real-time data from SportsRadar, Sleeper, or ESPN.

Data normalization: Convert stats from multiple APIs into unified tables (players, teams, matchups, injuries, projections).

Database: Store historical and current stats, league settings, and user rosters.

Cache layer: Redis for frequently accessed stats to reduce API calls.

2. Analytics Engine

Compute advanced metrics (fantasy points per game, efficiency, injury risk, matchup strength).

Compare user roster vs league averages ‚Üí detect gaps and strengths.

Rank free agents and trade targets based on team needs and projected stats.

3. LLM Integration

Input: roster + stats + league info + available players

Prompt: ‚ÄúAct as a fantasy basketball GM. Suggest trades or lineup changes. Explain why.‚Äù

Output: Recommendation: Trade Player A for Player B to balance rebounds.
Explanation: Your team is weak on rebounds; Player B has a high rebound per game average.


Optionally, generate strategic narratives or ‚Äúcoach‚Äôs advice‚Äù style reports.

4. API Endpoints

GET /roster/{user_id} ‚Üí current team stats

POST /recommendation ‚Üí LLM-generated advice

GET /players/trending ‚Üí top waiver pickups

POST /trade-simulation ‚Üí simulate trade impact on projected points

5. Optional Advanced Features

Live scoring integration: Update rosters and predictions in real time during games.

Notification system: Slack, Discord, or mobile push alerts for trade suggestions or lineup changes.

Interactive UI: Drag-and-drop roster management, visualize trade impacts, see LLM advice side by side.

Gamified analytics: Rank leagues by ‚Äúteam efficiency‚Äù or LLM-suggested optimal roster.

What it would ‚Äúlook like‚Äù fully built

User logs in ‚Üí backend fetches live stats ‚Üí LLM analyzes roster ‚Üí returns advice like a personal assistant coach.

Could be used during fantasy drafts or weekly management.

Unique, fun project that demonstrates API orchestration, backend data analytics, and LLM reasoning.
